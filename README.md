- 👋 Hi, I'm @veronixsee, a 3rd year information system student with a knack for clean and efficient code.
- 👀 I'm interested in expanding my skills and exploring different programming languages.
- 🌱 Currently, I'm honing my skills in web development and brushing up on my algorithms.
- 💞️ I'm open to collaborating on interesting projects and contributing to meaningful codebases.
- 📫 You can reach me via email at [veronicagrace128@gmail.com].
- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy singing, reading, and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen when I'm not coding!
